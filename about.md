Welcome! I'm Husam Gameel, known in the cybersecurity community as **Oppenheim3r**. I'm a cybersecurity professional with a passion for offensive and defensive security, combining real-world attack simulation with deep forensic analysis and threat detection.

My expertise spans red teaming, penetration testing, digital forensics (DFIR), threat hunting, and malware analysis. I specialize in process creation analysis, reverse engineering malicious behaviors, and developing detection rules using Sigma, YARA, and custom threat hunting techniques. Additionally, I focus on the security of modern APIs, including REST and GraphQL, identifying vulnerabilities and helping secure critical application layers against real-world attack vectors.

Through this blog, I share technical research, practical experiences, and insights gained from hands-on security assessments and continuous learning. My goal is to contribute to the cybersecurity community by providing actionable, technical content that empowers both aspiring and experienced security professionals in the fields of offensive security, DFIR, and defensive engineering.
