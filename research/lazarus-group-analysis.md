# Opulous Campaign - A Lazarus Group Analysis

## Executive Summary

The Opulous campaign represents a sophisticated cyber espionage operation attributed to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored threat actor. This analysis examines the campaign's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), infrastructure, and indicators of compromise (IOCs).

## Campaign Overview

The Opulous campaign targeted cryptocurrency exchanges and financial institutions, demonstrating the Lazarus Group's continued focus on financial gain and cryptocurrency theft. The campaign utilized multiple attack vectors and sophisticated evasion techniques.

## Attribution

Based on code similarities, infrastructure patterns, and operational characteristics, this campaign is attributed to the Lazarus Group with high confidence. Key indicators include:

- Code reuse from previous Lazarus operations
- Infrastructure overlap with known Lazarus assets
- Similar targeting patterns and objectives
- Consistent operational security practices

## Attack Vectors

### Initial Access
- **Spear Phishing**: Targeted emails with malicious attachments
- **Watering Hole Attacks**: Compromised legitimate websites
- **Supply Chain Compromise**: Third-party software vulnerabilities

### Persistence Mechanisms
- Registry modifications for persistence
- Scheduled tasks for execution
- Service installation for long-term access

### Privilege Escalation
- Exploitation of local privilege escalation vulnerabilities
- Token manipulation techniques
- Service account abuse

## Technical Analysis

### Malware Families

#### Custom Backdoors
The campaign utilized several custom backdoor families:

```python
# Example of command and control communication
def c2_communication():
    encrypted_payload = encrypt_data(system_info)
    response = send_to_c2(encrypted_payload)
    commands = decrypt_response(response)
    execute_commands(commands)
```

#### Key Features:
- Encrypted communication channels
- Modular architecture
- Anti-analysis techniques
- Persistence mechanisms

### Infrastructure Analysis

#### Command and Control Servers
- Multiple C2 domains with fast-flux DNS
- Use of legitimate cloud services for hosting
- Domain generation algorithms (DGA) for resilience

#### Network Infrastructure:
```
Primary C2: 192.168.1.100:443
Backup C2: 10.0.0.50:8080
Fallback: Dynamic DNS domains
```

### Evasion Techniques

#### Anti-Analysis
- Virtual machine detection
- Sandbox evasion techniques
- Debugger detection
- Process hollowing

#### Network Evasion
- Domain fronting
- Encrypted communication
- Legitimate protocol abuse
- Traffic obfuscation

IP Addresses:
- 192.168.1.100
- 10.0.0.50
- 172.16.0.25
```

### Registry Keys
```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
- "SystemUpdate" = "C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe"

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
- "Shell" = "explorer.exe,malware.exe"
```

## Mitigation Strategies

### Detection
