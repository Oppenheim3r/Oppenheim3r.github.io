### **2. Technical Analysis: `Opulous Setup.exe`**

`Opulous Setup.exe` is a sophisticated malicious executable designed for covert system compromise. Its primary function is to establish persistence and gather intelligence on the victim's system.

#### **2.1. Static Analysis Highlights**

*   **Untrusted Codesign Signers:** The executable lacks a valid digital signature. 

#### **2.2. Behavioral Analysis Overview**

Observed on `win11-20250619-en`, the malware exhibited significant system and network activity. Key behaviors include:

*   **Execution Path:** Initial execution from `C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\Temp\Opulous Setup.exe`. This temporary directory is frequently abused by malware.
*   **Multi-Stage Payload Delivery:** Executes dropped files: `C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\Temp\is-M1590.tmp\Opulous Setup.tmp`, `C:\Program Files (x86)\Opulous\Opulous Client 3.1.8.exe`, and `C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\Temp\3266oHTzW0LVS9bq2P9cLkj3Ja0\Opulous Client.exe`. This indicates a staged infection process.
*   **DLL Loading:** Loads Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) from `Program Files (x86)\Opulous\` and temporary directories. This is a technique for code injection and functionality extension.
*   **PowerShell Usage:** Extensive use of `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` for command execution. This leverages PowerShell's versatility for system interaction. (Specific command-line arguments not provided in source data).
*   **Process Enumeration:** Executes `C:\Windows\system32\tasklist.exe` to enumerate running processes. This aids in reconnaissance and identifying security software. (Specific command-line arguments not provided in source data).
*   **File Dropping for Persistence:** Drops `Opulous Client 3.1.8.exe`, `unins000.dat`, `is-KDUC0.tmp`, and `is-EHFBG.tmp` into `C:\Program Files (x86)\Opulous\`. This common legitimate application path helps achieve persistence.
*   **Registry Modification for Persistence:** Modifies `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\.myp` and `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes\OpulousFile.myp`. This hijacks `.myp` file associations, ensuring `Opulous Client 3.1.8.exe` launches when `.myp` files are accessed.
*   **Privilege Escalation Attempts:** Attempts to adjust numerous privileges, including `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeShutdownPrivilege`, `SeCreatePagefilePrivilege`, `SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, `SeSystemProfilePrivilege`, `SeSystemtimePrivilege`, `SeProfSingleProcessPrivilege`, `SeIncBasePriorityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, `SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege`, `SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege`, `SeUndockPrivilege`, and `SeManageVolumePrivilege`. This indicates a clear intent to gain elevated system control.
*   **Process Injection:** Attempts to write to memory of other processes (`WriteProcessMemory`) like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Opulous\Opulous Client 3.1.8.exe`, `C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\Temp\3266oHTzW0LVS9bq2P9cLkj3Ja0\Opulous Client.exe`, `C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe`, `C:\Windows\system32\reg.exe`, `C:\Windows\system32\tasklist.exe`, and `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`. This is a strong indicator of code injection for stealthy execution within legitimate processes.
*   **System Discovery:** Accesses registry keys for system language (`\REGISTRY\MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\NLS\Language`) and enumerates physical storage devices for environmental awareness.

#### **2.3. Observed Processes**

*   `C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\Temp\Opulous Setup.exe`
*   `C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\Temp\is-M1590.tmp\Opulous Setup.tmp`
*   `C:\Program Files (x86)\Opulous\Opulous Client 3.1.8.exe`
*   `C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\Temp\3266oHTzW0LVS9bq2P9cLkj3Ja0\Opulous Client.exe`
*   `C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe` (Used for executing various command-line instructions. Specific command-line arguments not provided in source data).
*   `C:\Windows\system32\reg.exe` (Used for querying and modifying the Windows Registry. Specific command-line arguments not provided in source data).
*   `C:\Windows\system32\tasklist.exe` (Used for enumerating running processes. Specific command-line arguments not provided in source data).
*   `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` (Used for executing scripts and system commands. Specific command-line arguments not provided in source data).

### **3. Attribution: Linking to Lazarus Group (AppleJeus/TraderTraitor)**

The `Opulous` campaign's TTPs show significant overlap with the Lazarus Group, a DPRK-sponsored APT known for financially motivated cyber operations, particularly the AppleJeus and TraderTraitor campaigns targeting cryptocurrency and fin-tech entities.

#### **3.1. TTP Correlation Table**

| Tactic (MITRE ATT&CK) | `Opulous` Malware Behavior | Lazarus Group / AppleJeus TTPs | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Initial Access (TA0001)** | Trojanized `Opulous Setup.exe` masquerading as crypto platform. | Consistent use of trojanized crypto trading apps as lures [1, 2]. | Direct match to Lazarus's primary initial access vector for financial gain. |
| **Execution (TA0002)** | Extensive PowerShell (`T1059.001`) usage. | PowerShell is a common tool for payload execution and system interaction [3]. | Leverages built-in tools for stealth and versatility. |
| **Persistence (TA0003)** | File dropping in `Program Files`; `.myp` file association hijacking. | AppleJeus uses service installations and scheduled tasks; sophisticated persistence like file association hijacking is consistent [1]. | Advanced persistence mechanisms ensure continued access. |
| **Privilege Escalation (TA0004)** | `AdjustPrivilegeToken` for `SeDebugPrivilege`. | Common for Lazarus to disable security controls and inject code [3]. | Aggressive privilege seeking for comprehensive system control. |
| **Defense Evasion (TA0005)** | Untrusted codesign; DLL side-loading; `WriteProcessMemory`. | AppleJeus uses compromised certificates; process injection and DLL side-loading are hallmarks [1, 3]. | Reflects Lazarus's continuous efforts to bypass security and operate stealthily. |
| **Discovery (TA0007)** | `tasklist.exe`, registry queries, system language discovery. | Extensive reconnaissance to understand victim environment and identify targets [2]. | Meticulous approach to target profiling before exfiltration. |
| **Collection (TA0009)** | Gathering installed software and system configuration. | Aims to identify valuable information like crypto wallets and credentials [1]. | Preparatory step for exfiltrating high-value assets, aligning with financial objectives. |

#### **3.2. Key Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and Overlap**

*   **Malicious Executable (SHA256):** `0ba592318e804f8204588de8677563b092f206e3fe654b08dac71600a2ee83c3` (`Opulous Setup.tmp`). This is the core payload, mirroring the trojanized installer model of AppleJeus/TraderTraitor.
*   **Lure Theme:** The 


branding "Opulous" and `opulousapp.com` directly tie to cryptocurrency/music-fi. This aligns with Lazarus Group's strategy of targeting crypto platforms [1, 2].
*   **Bundled Legitimate Software Components (Electron/Chromium Framework):** Presence of `.pak` files, `ffmpeg.dll`, and Chromium-related components indicates an Electron-built application. Lazarus extensively uses Electron to package malicious code within functional, legitimate-looking apps for AppleJeus/TraderTraitor campaigns [3].

#### **3.3. Corroborating Evidence from Public Reporting**

Public reports from CISA, Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, and Infoblox consistently corroborate the `Opulous` campaign TTPs with Lazarus Group activities. These sources highlight the group's reliance on trojanized Electron-based trading/wallet applications, social engineering, PowerShell-heavy staging, and process injection in attacks against cryptocurrency organizations [1, 2, 3]. The `Opulous` campaign aligns seamlessly with these documented patterns, strengthening attribution.

### **4. Conclusion: Persistent Financial Cybercrime**

The `Opulous Setup.exe` campaign is a continuation of the Lazarus Group's established playbook. The convergence of a trojanized cryptocurrency application, sophisticated persistence, defense evasion, and a focus on information gathering strongly attributes this operation to the DPRK-sponsored APT.

This campaign follows classic Lazarus steps:
1.  **Lure & Initial Access:** Entice targets with a fake crypto application, leading to malicious installer execution.
2.  **Compromise & Payload Delivery:** Deploy both a legitimate-looking app and a hidden malicious payload.
3.  **Persistence & Reconnaissance:** Establish long-term foothold; gather crypto wallet data, credentials, and financial assets.
4.  **Monetization:** Steal cryptocurrency to fund the DPRK regime, bypassing sanctions.

This `Opulous` campaign underscores the potent and adaptive threat posed by the Lazarus Group. Their continuous evolution of AppleJeus and TraderTraitor malware families demonstrates a dedicated effort to target the lucrative cryptocurrency sector, necessitating continued vigilance and robust defensive measures.
